 Now here we need to modify few things. At first we need to edit the /boot/config.txt file.
Now you need to open this file in any text editor. Here I am using nano:
sudo nano /boot/config.txt
 At the end of the file add the following lines:

dtparam=spi=on
dtoverlay=pi3-disable-bt
core_freq=250
enable_uart=1
force_turbo=1

Now save this by typing ctrl +x, then type y and press enter.
? Raspbian uses the UART as a serial console and so we need to turn off that functionality.
To do so we need to change the /boot/cmdline.txt file. For safety before editing the file
make a backup of that using the following command:

sudo cp /boot/cmdline.txt /boot/cmdline_backup.txt

Now to edit that file open that in text editor:
sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt

? Replace the content with the following line (delete everything in it and write down the
following content):

dwc_otg.lpm_enable=0 console=tty1 root=/dev/mmcblk0p2 rootfstype=ext4
elevator=deadline fsck.repair=yes rootwait quiet splash plymouth.ignore-serial-consoles
Now save this by typing ctrl +x, then type y and press enter.
? Now reboot pi using: sudo reboot

After the reboot now, we will check how our module is working.
Before checking this out makes sure that the blue LED in the Neo 6M is blinking. Basically the
blinking of blue LED means that it’s receiving the data perfectly. Generally it takes few minutes
to blink the LED after giving power to the module. So wait until that. And if it’s not blinking
even after 5 minutes then go to a window side area or any place under the open sky. In the image
below you can see how the blue LED should blink.

? When the blue led is blinking, run the following command:
 sudo cp /dev/ttyAMA0 /home/your_linux_username/deep/data.txt

Now you will see a lots of data like shown in the below image. That basically means that it’s
working to stop this type Ctrl + c.
The output result may be save as super user file so we have to give grant permission to the file
OR we can go to file manager to use command sudo nautilus ,then open the text file.
